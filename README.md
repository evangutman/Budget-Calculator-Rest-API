##installation

1. Create a virtual environment for Python.
2. From the root of the repository run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add the `FLASK_APP` variable to your path. (e.g. `export FLASK_APP=budget.py`).

## Running the App

Once installed, the application can be started with `flask run`.

##Note
I was having trouble only including the packages necessary to run budget.py in my vertual environemnt so I put all global packages on my computer in requirements.txt
  -Sorry for the inconvenience
